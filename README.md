# While he practiced his Markdown...

he was making the children feel important.\
that one day, they could be important.

that was the way of a teacher,\
of a true man.

and did you not see the glow of their faces,\
when he called them men?

when he called them warriors?

and is it not so that we become most quickly,\
the persons we think we are?

sometimes I wonder...
